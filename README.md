# Dynamic Landing Page Headline Example

This project demonstrates a dynamic landing page that customizes the headline based on URL parameters. It's perfect for personalized marketing campaigns, allowing visitors to see tailored messages based on the traffic source or promotion.

## Features
- **Dynamic Headline Generation**: Updates the headline based on the `utm_source` parameter in the URL.
- **Customizable Campaigns**: Easily define unique headlines for different marketing sources or promotions.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly and visually appealing layout.
- **Call-to-Action**: A prominent button encourages visitors to take action (e.g., "Shop Now").

## How It Works
1. The script checks the URL for the `utm_source` parameter (e.g., `?utm_source=google`).
2. Based on the parameter value, it dynamically updates the headline with a predefined message.
3. If no matching parameter is found, a default headline ("Welcome to Our Website") is displayed.
